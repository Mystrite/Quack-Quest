TO DO:
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?	[might just not]
	-rewrite damage system for OOP
	-finish projectile collisions 
	-add enemies
	-leaderboard system
	-create4 proprietary rect overlap function, which returns truth and colliding object! :D :) â˜º
ISSUES:

IDEAS:
	- boon/bane system
	- get to choose from selection every chamber, boons are buffs, banes are debuffs (but give extra points)
