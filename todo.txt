TO DO:
-rewrite WFC code using probability matrix and recursion.
	-Add tile types (DONE? - might be more to add)
	-Need to do recursive generation now. (WORKS??)
	-Easy idea to prevent exit/entrance blocking -> start generation from exits/entrances
-for textures:
	- preset void could literally just be black, i think that would be pretty cool.
