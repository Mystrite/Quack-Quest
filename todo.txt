TO DO:
-rewrite WFC code using probability matrix and recursion. [DONE??]
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?	[might just not]
	-entropy idea
-time to start on pygame I think, will sort out player movement first so i understand how it works.
-switch tile dict to array of tile objects: the object should have an image, ID
-need to preload all the images, could be done in a function i guess?
	-important: next thing to do is make sure all the tiles display correctly :D
		-read in the current map, then iterate over the tiles?

ISSUES:
	- converts O_WALL into floor tile, directly below exit ?? looks like issue with manual assign - was issue with recursion ---- should be fixed now

-for textures:
	- preset void could literally just be black, i think that would be pretty cool.
	- use piskel for animations probably, best to make an /assets dir.
IDEAS:
	- boon/bane system
	- get to choose from selection every chamber, boons are buffs, banes are debuffs (but give extra points)
