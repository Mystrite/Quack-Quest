TO DO:
-rewrite WFC code using probability matrix and recursion. [DONE??]
	-Add tile types (DONE? - might be more to add)
	-Need to do recursive generation now. (WORKS??) --- change weighting method to consider all adjacent tiles, PROB_MATRIX needs to be rewritten.
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?	[might just not]
-2d array that handles entities [probably a bad idea]
-time to start on pygame I think, will sort out player movement first so i understand how it works.

ISSUES:
	- converts O_WALL into floor tile, directly below exit ?? looks like issue with manual assign - was issue with recursion ---- should be fixed now

-for textures:
	- preset void could literally just be black, i think that would be pretty cool.
	- keep it simple, quality doesnt matter too much
