TO DO:
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?	[might just not]
	-restructure duck class such that it inherits from new entity class, used for bullets and enemies etc. needed for collision code.
	-leaderboard system
	-the game.
	^\w*$
ISSUES:

IDEAS:
	- boon/bane system
	- get to choose from selection every chamber, boons are buffs, banes are debuffs (but give extra points)
