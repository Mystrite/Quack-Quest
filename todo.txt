TO DO:
-rewrite WFC code using probability matrix and recursion.
	-Add tile types (DONE? - might be more to add)
	-Need to do recursive generation now. (WORKS??) --- change weighting method to consider all adjacent tiles, PROB_MATRIX needs to be rewritten.
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?
-2d array that handles entities

ISSUES:
	- converts O_WALL into floor tile, directly below exit ?? looks like issue with manual assign - was issue with recursion ---- should be fixed now

-for textures:
	- preset void could literally just be black, i think that would be pretty cool.

IDEAS:
	- boon/bane system
	- get to choose from selection every chamber, boons are buffs, banes are debuffs (but give extra points)
