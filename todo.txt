TO DO:
-rewrite WFC code using probability matrix and recursion.
	-Add tile types (DONE? - might be more to add)
	-Need to do recursive generation now. (WORKS??)
	-Easy idea to prevent exit/entrance blocking -> start generation from exits/entrances
	-an N number of rooms should be preloaded at the start, probably the best way to do this. 
	-implement some idea of preset rooms?
-2d array that handles entities

ISSUES:
	- converts O_WALL into floor tile, directly below exit ?? looks like issue with manual assign - was issue with recursion, should be fixed now

-for textures:
	- preset void could literally just be black, i think that would be pretty cool.
